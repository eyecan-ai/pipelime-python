## ML Cocktail: Training A Multi-Layer Perceptron Network

In this recipe we will train a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network to classify the well-known Iris dataset. You will learn how to:
1. [generate a dataset from scikit-learn and write it as Underfolder](ml_tutorial/convert_to_underfolder.md)
1. [split your data using Choixe and Piper](ml_tutorial/dataset_splitting.md)
1. add new items to the samples using entities and actions
1. create a new Pipelime Command to train your model
1. define a new stage for inference
1. draw the final DAG and track the execution
