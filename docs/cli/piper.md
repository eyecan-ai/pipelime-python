# Piper

In the [previous section](overview.md) we talked about commands you can run from the command line.
A really special pipelime command is `run`, which executes a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) of commands using the **Piper** engine.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph):
> a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a directed graph with no directed cycles. That is, it consists of vertices and edges (also called arcs), with each edge directed from one vertex to another, such that following those directions will never form a closed loop.

Here, the nodes are pipelime command to execute, while the edges are matched input/output ports.
Piper takes as input any field having a key `piper_port` set to `PiperPortType.INPUT` and
as output any field having a key `piper_port` set to `PiperPortType.OUTPUT`.
Then, it compares inputs and outputs by converting them to string.
For example, `InputDatasetInterface` and `OutputDatasetInterface` are converted to their input and output folder paths, respectively.

Now let's see how to use it:

```bash
$ pipelime run help
```

```bash

The `nodes` parameter is a mapping where the keys are node names, i.e., any unique string, and the values are the pipelime commands to execute.
Such commands can be specified as python objects, e.g., using the [`$model` directive](../choixe/directives.md#model), or, simply, by their title and arguments. For example:

```yaml
nodes:                              # ☚ The "nodes" argument of the "run" command
  good_split:                       # ☚ The title of the command to execute
    # ☟ the arguments of the command
    split-query:
      input: $var(input)            # ☚ this is a variable to be defined in the context
      output_selected: $tmp(good)
      query: "`metadata.label` == 'good'"
      grabber:
        num_workers: $var(nproc)    # ☚ another variable
  bad_split:                        # ☚ another command
    split-query:
      input: $var(input)
      output_selected: $tmp(bad)
      query: "`metadata.label` == 'bad'"
      grabber:
        num_workers: $var(nproc)
  good_train_test:
    split:
      input: $tmp(good)             # ☚ this is linked to "split-query.output_selected"
      splits:
        - output: $var(output)/train
          fraction: 0.8
        - output: $tmp(good_test)
          fraction: 0.8
      grabber:
        num_workers: $var(nproc)
  test_dataset:
    cat:
      inputs: [ $tmp(good_test), $tmp(bad) ]
      output: $var(output)/test
      grabber:
        num_workers: $var(nproc)
```

In the configuration above, we have a DAG with 4 nodes and some Choixe [variables](../choixe/directives.md#variables).
To get a usable DAG, these variables must be defined in the associated context.
To this end, just run `pipelime audit` as [shown before](overview.md#validate-a-configuration-and-write-a-context).
For example, a possible context might be:

```yaml
input: path/to/input
nproc: '6'
output: path/to/output
```

Also, remember that context options can be override from the command line using the [`@` syntax](overview.md).

To visualize what the DAG will do, we can draw it:

```bash
pipelime draw --config dag.yaml --context context.yaml
```

```{figure} ../images/dag.svg
:width: 70%
:align: center
```

Now we are ready to run the DAG. A few options are available:
- `include`/`exclude`: only nodes listed in `include` and not in `exclude` are run. If not specified, all nodes are run.
- `watch`: if `True`, the execution is monitored in the current console, otherwise you need to register your own listener.
- `token`: the execution token to be used to identify this run when monitoring it. If not specified, a new token is generated.

If you don't need advanced broadcasting features, you can just ignore the `token` option and leave `watch` to `True`.
